This is a proof of concept demo for using CHDK, and PTP (even on post 2009 canon cameras!) to re-create a photobooth as seen in a mall near you.

This code worked as-is using a ubuntu 10.04 laptop with an HP printer running HPLIP drivers. It was specifically utilized to create a wedding photobooth.

The purpose of release is to give back to the CHDK community, and allow for greater public development and consumption.
